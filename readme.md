# voxel-builder

Based on [a Three.js example](https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_interactive_voxelpainter)

Built to be used in ABC3D 3D printing workshops in libraries. 
Uses Three.js build 81, OrbitControls.js, Detector.js and STLExporter.js. 

When downloaded, cubes have a base size of 10mm. 

Tested on Chrome v54.

## Bugs to fix etc.

- block infinite zoom 
- ghost cube only changes color once moved 
- add favicon 
- won't download on Safari (opens in new window)

- mobile controls 
- continuous cube painting (when Alt maintained)
- add color encoding in STL
